# Raspberry Pi Datalogger

This repository contains code for my Engenieering thesis, this being a Datalogger, implemented on a Raspberry Pi.
Datalogger functions in a client - server architecture, gathering measurements from Modbus RTU485 slave devices. 
The Datalogger stores those measurements in an SQL database, which can be accesed using Modbus TCP protocol.
